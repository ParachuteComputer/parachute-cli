/**
 * Human-readable explanations for first-party Parachute OAuth scopes.
 *
 * Used by the consent screen to render each requested scope with a
 * one-sentence description, and by `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
 * to populate `scopes_supported` (closes cli#68).
 *
 * Keep these short and operator-facing. The reader is the hub's owner
 * deciding whether to grant a third-party app access — they need to
 * understand *what data the app will see* in plain language, not the
 * technical contract.
 *
 * Third-party module scopes pass through here without an entry —
 * `explainScope` falls back to the raw scope string and the consent UI
 * renders them verbatim. cli#56 (drop SERVICE_SPECS) plus the eventual
 * `parachute.json` `scopes.defines` field will let modules ship their
 * own descriptions; until then, the canonical Parachute scopes are
 * hardcoded here.
 *
 * Source of truth for the scope shape:
 * `parachute-patterns/patterns/oauth-scopes.md`.
